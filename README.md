# Channels / _Kanalis_

The Kanalis project offers a generic data flow interface for in-memory movement of
observability-related data between sources and outlets within an observed process or service. Much
like the Substrates project, it is a project that is utilized by other Humainary projects but at
runtime within the SPI infrastructure. It is observability for observability.
